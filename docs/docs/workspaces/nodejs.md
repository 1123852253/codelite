## General
---
Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. 
Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices. With Recent builds of CodeLite, it is possible to create, run and debug Node.js applications.

In short, Node.js is server side JavaScript engine

## The workspace
---

To fully maximize CodeLite's JavaScript capabilities, you first need to create a workspace. A Node.js workspace is simply a folder with a single JSON file `.workspace` which contains some metadata information about the workspace.
You can create a workspace for an existing source files or create a new workspace.

### Create a new workspace
---

- From the main menu, select `File` -> `New` -> `New workspace`
- Select `Node.js`
- In the dialog that shown, set the `Name` and the `Path` of the workspace
- Optionally, check the option to create the workspace on a separate directory

!!! Tip
    To create a workspace from an existing code base, select the workspace path to your code base location
    and make sure you un-check the option `Create the workspace in a separate directory`

!!! Tip
    Another way of creating a workspace from an existing code base: Open your file browser (Windows Explorer, Dolphin, Finder etc)
    drag the source code folder and drop it on the workspace view
