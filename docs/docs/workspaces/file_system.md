## When to use?
---

The workspace is intended for people who wish to use CodeLite for viewing, editing, debugging and code coding of an existing code base.
The tree view is filled automatically; there is no need to add files manually. Therefore it is very suitable for huge code bases.

## The tree view
---

Unlike the [default C/C++ workspace](default.md), this workspace offers no projects but is merely a reflection of the file system's current directory structure.
Also, any action on any folder in the tree view is applied to the file system (e.g. delete a file, folder etc).

## Set up
---

- From the `File` menu, select `New`  &#8594; `New workspace`
- Choose `File System Workspace`
- Select the folder containing your code and give the workspace a name

## Settings
---

- Open the settings dialogue by right clicking on the top level folder in the tree view and choosing `Settings...`
